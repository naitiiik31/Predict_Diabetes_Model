# 🩺 Predict Diabetes Model

## 📌 Overview
The Predict Diabetes Model project uses Machine Learning to analyze medical health data and predict whether a person has diabetes or not.  
This system is built using Python and leverages well-known classification algorithms to train a predictive model that can classify users as diabetic or non-diabetic based on input health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more.  
Users can run the model locally using a simple script or integrate it into a web interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict whether a person has diabetes using health measurements  
- Uses supervised Machine Learning classification  
- Preprocessing and training on medical dataset  
- Fast and efficient prediction  
- Easy to run locally  
- Beginner to intermediate level ML demonstration

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
- Load diabetes dataset (e.g., Pima Indian Diabetes dataset) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values if any)  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Train classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics  
- Predict outcomes for new input health data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn  
- Model: Supervised Classification  
- Dataset: diabetes.csv (medical health measurements) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🔧 How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository  
  git clone https://github.com/naitiiik31/Predict_Diabetes_Model

- Install dependencies  
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the prediction script or notebook  
  python DiabetesPredict.ipynb (via Jupyter Notebook)  
  or open `DiabetesPredict.ipynb` in Jupyter

## 🧪 Sample Output
- Input: Glucose: 148, BMI: 33.6, Age: 50  
  Output: **Diabetic**

- Input: Glucose: 85, BMI: 24.0, Age: 23  
  Output: **Non-Diabetic**

## 📈 Model Performance
- Uses accurate classification algorithm  
- Evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy  
- Consistent results on test samples  
- Works well on benchmark health dataset

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add a web or mobile user interface (e.g., Flask / Streamlit)  
- Use advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks  
- Add model explainability (SHAP / LIME)  
- Integrate real-time user input form for predictions  
- Deploy as a cloud API for health apps
